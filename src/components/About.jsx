        I’m Kushal Jain, a Software Developer with strong experience in Java,
        React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and MySQL. I specialize in building
        responsive, scalable, and maintainable web applications, backed by a
        solid foundation in Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures,
        Algorithms, and database design.
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently, I’m working as a Frontend Developer Intern at{" "}
        <strong>Ubuy India</strong>, where I contribute to UI development for a
        global e-commerce platform. My responsibilities include creating
        responsive user interfaces, optimizing performance, and collaborating
        with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality, user-centric
        experiences.
        <br />
        <br />
        Previously, I worked as a Frontend Developer at{" "}
        <strong>ZPLYS.AI</strong>, where I built interactive and scalable UI
        components using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I focused on
        performance optimization, reusable component architecture, and ensuring
        cross-browser compatibility.
        <br />
        <br />I have also developed impactful projects such as a{" "}
        <strong>Banking Application</strong> using Java, JDBC, and MySQL, and a{" "}
        <strong>Weather Application</strong> built with React, TypeScript, and
        Tailwind CSS, featuring dynamic theme switching and smooth UI
        transitions. These projects demonstrate my ability to combine efficient
        backend logic with clean, responsive frontend design.
        <br />
        <br />
        I’m passionate about continuous learning and enjoy solving complex
        problems, writing clean and efficient code, and building meaningful
        digital products that create real-world impact.
