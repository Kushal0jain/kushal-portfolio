        I’m Kushal Jain, a passionate and dedicated Software Developer with
        hands-on experience in both backend and frontend development. I
        specialize in Core Java, SQL, React.js, and Tailwind CSS, and have built
        scalable, responsive web applications through internships and real-world
        projects.
        <br />
        <br />
        During my role as a Java Developer Trainee at FUEL, I deepened my
        understanding of Java and MySQL, while mastering version control using
        Git in collaborative environments. As a Frontend Developer at ZPLYS.AI,
        I contributed to building user-friendly interfaces and enhancing
        performance in cross-functional team settings.
        <br />
        <br />
        I’ve also worked on key projects like a Banking Application using Java
        and JDBC, a Weather Application using React and Tailwind CSS, and a
        Personal Portfolio Website to showcase my work and skills. These
        projects highlight my ability to combine logical backend systems with
        dynamic, responsive UIs, while also demonstrating strong frontend design
        and user experience capabilities.
        <br />
        <br />
        I’m committed to continuous learning and enjoy problem-solving, writing
        clean code, and collaborating with teams to build impactful digital
        solutions.
