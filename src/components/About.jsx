        I'm a passionate developer with a background in science, now fully immersed in tech.
        After completing my MCA from Poornima University, I transitioned into software
        development, learning and building with Core Java, React, Tailwind CSS, SQL, and backend tools
        like MySql, MongoDB.
        <br /><br />
        Iâ€™ve worked on projects like Banking System and a responsive UI for a
        content analysis platform during my training at FUEL. I love clean code, solving
        logic problems, and turning ideas into reality.
        <br /><br />
        I also worked as Front-End Developer at ZPLYS.AI, where I honed my skills in
        React, Tailwind CSS, and backend tools like MongoDb. I contributed to
        the development of a user-friendly and efficient platform for content analysis.
