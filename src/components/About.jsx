  I’m Kushal Jain, a dedicated Software Developer skilled in Java, React.js,
  TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and MySQL. I have hands-on experience in building
  responsive and scalable applications, with a strong foundation in
  Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Algorithms, and database
  management.
  <br />
  <br />
  Currently, I’m working as a Frontend Developer Intern at <strong>Ubuy
  India</strong>, contributing to UI development for a global e-commerce
  platform. My role involves building responsive interfaces, optimizing
  performance, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver
  high-quality user experiences.
  <br />
  <br />
  Previously, I worked as a Frontend Developer at <strong>ZPLYS.AI</strong>,
  where I developed interactive UIs using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind,
  implemented scalable component structures, enhanced performance through
  optimization techniques, and ensured cross-browser compatibility.
  <br />
  <br />
  I’ve also built key projects such as a <strong>Banking Application</strong>
  using Java, JDBC, and MySQL, and a <strong>Weather Application</strong> using
  React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS with dynamic theme switching and smooth
  UI transitions. These projects reflect my ability to integrate efficient
  backend logic with clean, responsive frontend interfaces.
  <br />
  <br />
  I’m committed to continuous learning and enjoy solving problems, writing
  clean and efficient code, and building meaningful digital products that create
  impact.
